# PIA-Wg-Config-Generator

**A WireGuard config generator and daemon for Private Internet Access (PIA), built for Docker, Gluetun, routers and long-running tunnels.**

Private Internet Access does not provide static WireGuard configuration files through its user portal.

Instead, WireGuard connections are created through an authenticated API flow that dynamically provisions the required connection details, including keys, server assignment, gateway and DNS information.

This project automates that flow and makes PIA WireGuard practical for infrastructure-style setups such as Docker stacks, Gluetun, routers, firewalls and headless servers.

---

## Why This Exists

PIA’s WireGuard implementation is not really a “download once and forget” setup.

To establish a tunnel, a client needs to:

- authenticate with PIA,
- register a WireGuard public key,
- retrieve dynamic server and connection metadata,
- generate a valid WireGuard config,
- and optionally maintain a rolling port-forwarding lease.

That makes static configs awkward, especially for homelabs, containers and long-running VPN gateways.

This tool bridges that gap by providing:

- one-shot WireGuard config generation,
- daemon mode for long-running setups,
- automatic refresh support,
- rolling port-forwarding renewal,
- and integration-friendly output files for Docker/Gluetun style workflows.

In short, it turns PIA WireGuard into something much closer to a **start-it-and-forget-it** setup.

---

## Features

- One-shot WireGuard config generation to file or stdout
- Daemon mode with automatic config/session refresh
- Rolling PIA port-forwarding lease renewal
- Hook support after config refresh and when the forwarded port changes
- Region selection by ID, friendly name, or server common name
- Optional filtering to port-forwarding capable regions
- IPv6 modes: dual-stack, IPv4-only, or dual-stack with an ip6tables killswitch
- Token caching to avoid unnecessary authentication calls
- Works well with Docker, Gluetun, routers and headless systems
- Single self-contained Go binary

> [!IMPORTANT]
> PIA WireGuard sessions and port-forwarding leases may be ephemeral.
>
> This project is designed around refresh, automation and long-running infrastructure use cases.

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
go install github.com/thecodingrasta/pia-wg-config-generator@latest
```

### Or build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thecodingrasta/pia-wg-config-generator
cd pia-wg-config-generator
make build
```

### Generate a WireGuard config

```bash
pia-wg-config generate --username YOU --password SECRET --region uk_southampton -o wg0.conf
```

Or using environment variables:

```bash
PIA_USERNAME=you PIA_PASSWORD=secret pia-wg-config generate -o wg0.conf
```

The generated `wg0.conf` can be used with `wg-quick`, imported into WireGuard clients, loaded onto a router, or mounted into a VPN gateway container such as [Gluetun](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun).

---

## Commands

Daemon output files are written atomically to `--state-dir`:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `wg0.conf` | Generated WireGuard configuration |
| `status.json` | Daemon status snapshot |
| `forwarded_port` | Current forwarded port when port-forwarding is enabled |

---

## IPv6 Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|

| `off` | IPv4-only tunnel. IPv6 is not routed through WireGuard |
| `kill` | Dual-stack tunnel with an ip6tables rule to block IPv6 traffic outside the tunnel |

`kill` mode adds the following rules to the generated config:

```ini
PostUp = ip6tables -I OUTPUT ! -o %i -j REJECT
PostDown = ip6tables -D OUTPUT ! -o %i -j REJECT
```

---

## Docker / Gluetun

This is the recommended long-running setup.

The important pieces are:

1. Build the image locally and use it by tag in Compose.
2. Seed the first `/gluetun/wireguard/wg0.conf` once if the file does not exist yet.
3. Run the long-running daemon inside Gluetun's network namespace.
4. The daemon refreshes `wg0.conf`, restarts Gluetun, exits, and is restarted by Docker into Gluetun's new network namespace.
5. On the restarted daemon process, it waits for the PIA gateway, then renews/writes `forwarded_port`.

Build the image once:

```bash
docker build -t pia-wg-config-generator:local .
```

Seed the initial config once on a new install:

```bash
docker run --rm --env-file .env -v ./config/gluetun:/gluetun pia-wg-config-generator:local generate --region=${PIA_REGION} --port-forwarding --ipv6-mode=${IPV6_MODE} --outfile=/gluetun/wireguard/wg0.conf --verbose
```

That seed step is the startup barrier for a fresh install. After it has created `./config/gluetun/wireguard/wg0.conf`, Compose starts in this order:

1. `gluetun` starts from the existing config.
2. `gluetun` becomes healthy.
3. `pia-wg-daemon` starts because it depends on `gluetun: service_healthy`.

Then use it in Compose:

```yaml
services:
  gluetun:
    image: qmcgaw/gluetun:latest
    container_name: gluetun
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    devices:
      - /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun
    environment:
      VPN_SERVICE_PROVIDER: custom
      VPN_TYPE: wireguard
      UPDATER_PERIOD: 0
    volumes:
      - ./config/gluetun:/gluetun
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "wget -qO- https://api.ipify.org >/dev/null 2>&1 || exit 1"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 10
      start_period: 60s

  pia-wg-daemon:
    image: pia-wg-config-generator:local
    container_name: pia-wg-daemon
    network_mode: "service:gluetun"
    environment:
      PIA_USERNAME: ${PIA_USERNAME}
      PIA_PASSWORD: ${PIA_PASSWORD}
    command: >
      daemon
        --region=${PIA_REGION}
        --state-dir=/gluetun/wireguard
        --port-forwarding
        --refresh-interval=12h
        --retry-delay=5m
        --ipv6-mode=${IPV6_MODE}
        --wait-for-gateway
        --restart-container=gluetun
        --verbose
    volumes:
      - ./config/gluetun:/gluetun
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    depends_on:
      gluetun:
        condition: service_healthy
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Example `.env`:

```ini
PIA_USERNAME=your_pia_username
PIA_PASSWORD=your_pia_password
PIA_REGION=ca_toronto
IPV6_MODE=kill
```

See [`docs/gluetun.md`](docs/gluetun.md) for the fuller setup guide and troubleshooting notes.

## Routers

The generated `wg0.conf` is a standard WireGuard configuration and should work with routers/firewalls that support WireGuard, including:

- OpenWrt
- pfSense
- OPNsense
- MikroTik RouterOS
- other WireGuard-compatible systems

The config includes the usual WireGuard fields:

- `[Interface]` — `PrivateKey`, `Address`, `DNS`
- `[Peer]` — `PublicKey`, `AllowedIPs`, `Endpoint`, `PersistentKeepalive`

Router-specific notes live in [`system-tests/routers/README.md`](system-tests/routers/README.md).

---

## Windows Notes

On Windows, PIA’s token endpoint may reject requests made through the system `curl.exe` due to its Schannel TLS fingerprint.

If that happens, point the tool at an OpenSSL-linked curl binary:

```powershell
$env:CURL_PATH = "C:\tools\curl-openssl\curl.exe"
pia-wg-config generate -o wg0.conf
```

The tool can still fall back to the metadata server if curl is unavailable, but setting `CURL_PATH` can improve reliability and token caching.

---

## Testing

Unit tests are offline and use vendored dependencies.

```bash
make test
make test-race
make lint
```

Integration tests require real PIA credentials:

```bash
PIA_USERNAME=you PIA_PASSWORD=secret make test-integration
```

System tests require Docker:

```bash
PIA_USERNAME=you PIA_PASSWORD=secret \
  docker compose -f system-tests/gluetun/docker-compose.yml \
  --env-file system-tests/gluetun/.env \
  up --build --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from tester
```

CI runs on GitHub Actions and covers:

- unit tests on Linux, macOS and Windows,
- race detector on Linux,
- binary build artefacts,
- integration/system tests when PIA secrets are configured.

## Architecture

High-level project structure:

```text
main.go               CLI entry point
pia/pia.go            PIA API client
pia/wg.go             WireGuard config generation
pia/pf.go             Port-forwarding client
pia/token_fetcher.go  curl-based token acquisition
pia/token_cacher.go   Disk token cache
pia/helpers.go        Shared helpers/utilities
```

Token acquisition strategy:

1. Use cached token when available.
2. Try curl against PIA’s token endpoint.
3. Fall back to the metadata server.

Port-forwarding flow:

1. Authenticate and retrieve a token.
2. Generate and write the refreshed WireGuard config.
3. Restart Gluetun through Docker using `--restart-container`.
4. Persist pending port-forwarding metadata and exit so Docker restarts the daemon into Gluetun's new network namespace.
5. Wait for the PIA gateway to be reachable through the active tunnel.
6. Request a port-forwarding signature and bind the forwarded port.
7. Renew the lease periodically.
8. Write the active port to `forwarded_port`.
9. Run `--on-port-change` if the port changes.

---

## v1 Scope

The goal is to keep this tool infrastructure-friendly without overcomplicating it.

For v1, the supported surface is:

- one-shot WireGuard config generation,
- region listing and port-forwarding capable region filtering,
- daemon refresh with retry behaviour,
- Gluetun config refresh and restart integration,
- rolling PIA port-forwarding renewal,
- `forwarded_port` output for downstream applications,
- and documented Docker, Gluetun, desktop and router workflows.

Future changes should preserve those workflows unless a replacement is demonstrably simpler and more reliable.

## Background & Credits

This project is based on the WireGuard workflow documented by Private Internet Access in their open-source [manual-connections](https://github.com/pia-foss/manual-connections) repository.

The initial Go implementation was inspired by [kylegrantlucas/pia-wg-config](https://github.com/kylegrantlucas/pia-wg-config), with additional improvements informed by [Ephemeral-Dust/pia-wg-config](https://github.com/Ephemeral-Dust/pia-wg-config).

This is also my first Go project, so it's been a solid learning experience as well as a practical tool for my own infrastructure.
